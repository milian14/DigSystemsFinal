# 5G vs 4G

Understanding the evolution from 4G to 5G technology reveals significant improvements that justify the transition to the newer generation of mobile technology. Below are key differences and enhancements introduced by 5G:

## Speed
- **4G:** Offers download speeds of up to 100 Mbps, which supports streaming, browsing, and downloads effectively for most users.
- **5G:** Promises download speeds of up to 10 Gbps, reducing download times from minutes to seconds and supporting higher-quality streaming and more complex online activities.

## Latency
- **4G:** The average latency is around 20-30 milliseconds.
- **5G:** Drastically reduces latency to as low as 1 millisecond, improving the responsiveness of applications and enabling new functionalities like real-time control of devices and enhanced gaming experiences.

## Capacity and Connectivity
- **4G:** Supports thousands of devices per square kilometer.
- **5G:** Can support up to one million devices in the same area, making it ideal for densely populated urban areas and for powering the Internet of Things (IoT).

## Efficiency and Coverage
- **4G:** Provides good coverage but struggles with consistency in crowded areas or at the edge of the network.
- **5G:** Designed to provide more consistent and reliable coverage, even in high demand situations, with the use of advanced antenna technology and wider spectrum bands.
